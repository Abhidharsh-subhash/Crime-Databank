# Crime-Databank
In this project, I created a comprehensive crime data bank system with three interconnected modules: user, admin, and police. 

The user module allows individuals to register complaints and report incidents related to crimes. Users can provide detailed information about the incident, including the nature of the crime, date, time, location, and any supporting evidence. This module ensures that users have a platform to report crimes and seek assistance from law enforcement agencies.

The police module is designed for law enforcement officers to access and manage reported incidents. Police can review and update the status of ongoing investigations, record any findings or progress made, and communicate with the users regarding the case. This module streamlines the process of managing and tracking criminal investigations, ensuring effective collaboration between police and users.

The admin module serves as a centralized hub for system administrators to oversee and monitor the entire crime data bank. Administrators have access to all reported incidents, including details provided by users and updates made by the police. They can view the overall progress of investigations, generate reports, and analyze crime trends. The admin module provides comprehensive oversight and helps in making informed decisions regarding resource allocation and strategic planning.
